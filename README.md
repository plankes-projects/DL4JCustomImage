# DL4JCustomImage #
Simplified DeepLearning4J example for custom images.
This is an Eclipse Maven project.

Most probably you will get following error on start: jnind4j.dll: %1 is not a valid Win32 application
To fix this put -Djava.library.path="" into your WM arguments.
In Eclipse you can do this there: Run Configuration -> Arguments -> WM arguments
